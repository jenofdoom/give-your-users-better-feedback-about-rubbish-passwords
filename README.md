To serve the demo and slides properly you'll need
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and the to run `npm install` both
here and in the slides directory.

## Serving the demo

In a terminal, from this folder:

`npm run build && npm run demo`

## Serving the slides

In a terminal, from this folder:

`npm run slides`

## Examining the demo code

All of the demo code is in the `src` folder. If you would like to try having a
fiddle with it make sure you're running `npm start` in a terminal window from
this directory so Gulp watches for file changes and recompiles.

The most relevant file is `src/js/main.js`.

## Speaker notes

When running the presentation slides, press `s` on the keyboard, or have a look
at `notes.md`.
